Here's a `README.md` file that explains how to set up and run the App Usage Tracker:

# App Usage Tracker

This is a Python-based application that tracks the time spent on different applications on your PC. The application uses the `tkinter` library for the GUI and `psutil`, `pygetwindow`, and other libraries to track active windows. The tracked data is displayed in a table, and it can be visualized as a chart or saved to a CSV file.

## Features

- **Track App Usage**: Monitor the time spent on different applications in real-time.
- **Data Visualization**: View the tracked data in a horizontal bar chart.
- **CSV Export**: Save the usage data to a CSV file.
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use graphical user interface built with `tkinter`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You also need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install tkinter psutil pygetwindow matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the script.

2. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Run the script** using the following command:

   ```bash
   python POSEDETECTION2.py
   ```

4. The application window will open, showing the current tracking status as "Tracking is OFF".

## Usage

- **Start Tracking**: Click on the "Start Tracking" button to begin tracking app usage. The status will update to "Tracking is ON".

- **Stop Tracking**: Click on the "Stop Tracking" button to stop tracking. The tracked data will be saved to `app_usage_data.csv`, and the table and chart will update with the collected data.

- **View Data**: The usage data will be displayed in a table and as a horizontal bar chart within the application window.

- **About**: Click the "About" button to view information about the application.

## Files

- `POSEDETECTION2.py`: The main Python script that runs the app.
- `app_usage_data.csv`: The CSV file where the tracked usage data is saved.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for tracking specific applications of interest.
- Include more detailed analytics like daily, weekly, or monthly usage reports.
- Implement notifications or alerts based on app usage time.
